    <h3>INSTRUCTIONS</h3>
    <br>
    <ol>
        <li>Boil 6 cups of water in a large pot over high heat and cook the pasta according to the package directions. Drain the pasta, rinse with cold water (so it doesn’t clump, can also toss a little olive oil on it to prevent clumping) and set aside.</li>
        <li>While the pasta is cooking, add the butter, olive oil and onion to a large pot over medium-high heat and cook for 3-4 minutes, or until the onion becomes translucent.</li>
        <li>Add the red bell pepper, garlic, Cajun seasoning, basil, paprika, ground black pepper, salt and cayenne pepper. Stir to combine and cook for 3 more minutes or until the bell pepper starts to become soft.</li>
        <li>Add the chicken and stir and cook for another 6-8 minutes or until the chicken is cooked through.</li>
        <li>Add the parmesan, heavy cream, cream cheese and chicken broth and stir and cook for 8-10 minutes or until the sauce starts to thicken and the cream cheese has fully melted.</li>
        <li>Add the cooked and drained pasta and stir to coat pasta with sauce. Cook for 2-3 minutes, then serve with freshly chopped parsley on top, if desired.</li>
    </ol>
